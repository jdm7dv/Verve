HOWTO: Building the .NET Bio API Document

Run $MBI\DevelopmentBranch\Bio\BuildTools\BuildScripts\GenerateDocumentLocally.cmd.
The script checks for the prerequisites (Visual Studio Tool for Office Runtime 4 and Microsoft Office Excel 2007/2010), then builds the .NET Bio solution and generates the .chm file (bio.chm).
The build output is placed in the folder $MBI\DevelopmentBranch\Bio\Build\LocalBuild\Target\docs.
The CHM is created in the $MBI\DevelopmentBranch\Bio\Build\LocalBuild\Binaries\docs.

Note: Please make sure you have Sandcastle and HTML Help Compiler are installed before running the script.
