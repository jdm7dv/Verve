.NET Bio: Readme.txt
Version 1.01, March 2012 

.NET Bio is an open source, reusable .NET library and application programming interface (API) for bioinformatics.

.NET Bio is available at http://bio.codeplex.com. It is licensed under the OSI approved Apache 2.0 License, a copy of which may be found here: http://bio.codeplex.com/license. 

KNOWN ISSUES
============
- Current issues are listed here: http://bio.codeplex.com/workitem/list/advanced

- Any single RNA, DNA, or protein sequence in .NET Bio is limited to a length of 2 billion characters. The largest human chromosome is 250Mbp so the single sequence limit should NOT be a limiting factor in your development. If you experience issues related with this limit please post on the issue tracker tab on the Codeplex site. This is not a data size limit for the assembly process. 

CHANGES FROM VERSION 1.0 TO VERSION 1.01
========================================

Breaking Changes

- .NET Bio no longer autodetects the subtype of a FASTQ file. This is due to a change in quality scoring between versions 1.5 and 1.8 of the Illumina FASTQ file format, preventing .NET Bio from automatically distinguishing between these formats.

- The ISequenceRangeParser has renamed the FileTypes property to SupportedFileTypes for the interface and single implementation (BedParser). 

- ISequenceRangeParser now derives from IParser for conformity.

- The RegisteredAddIn.GetAlphabets() method has been removed. The functionality was moved to a private method on the Alphabets class. You should just use Alphabets.All to retrieve the list of custom alphabets 

- The BioExcel add-in imports data to worksheets differently. If you depend on the order of rows + cells, you will need to adjust your scripts.

Non-breaking changes

- .NET Bio now supports the SFF (Standard Flowgram Format) in support of sequences generated by the Roche 454 sequencer.

- The Bio.Hpc.Distributeapp.exe has been renamed to be DistributeApp.exe

- The FileFormatConverter.exe is now installed into the Tools directory

- Several new extension methods have been added to Bio.dll
   	ISequence.ConvertToString
   	IAlphabet.CheckIsTermination(byte/char)
	IAlphabet.CheckIsGap(char)
	IAlphabet.CheckIsAmbiguous(char)
	IAlphabet.GetFriendlyName(char)

- SAMBAM parser and formatter have been updated to support new CIGAR and additional optional fields according to specification 1.4.

- Several bugs from 1.0 were resolved in this release.
